- [The Fibonacci Spiral]
The Fibonacci spiral is a visual representation created by drawing arcs that connect the opposite corners of squares with side lengths corresponding to the Fibonacci sequence. Starting with two squares of size 1, the Fibonacci spiral expands by adding squares of sizes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, following the Fibonacci sequence. By drawing quarter circles inside each square, the resulting spiral shape emerges
